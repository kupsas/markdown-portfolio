However, the biggest contribution I can/want to make is usually in the following:
- **Helping people become better** - I really want to help people understand themselves better and empower them to take better decisions.
- As a career, I've started out in _Data Science and Analytics_ and this is what has brought me to GitHub in the first place!
- I'm also tremendously interested in _**product management**_ and _**management consulting**_. I hope to venture into these someday!
