Hmm, if I was asked about material stuff I really like then the following would definitely make the list:
* Soccer. As I mentioned, I'm a huge fan of Manchester United. :heart:
* Food. Absolutely love eating new dishes. Vegetarian tho. :smile:
* Travel. The pandemic has shut my doors, but not the spirit!
* Reading books and articles. I'm constantly devouring content online/offline. Helps me stay updated with the world.
